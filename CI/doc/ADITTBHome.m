%% ANALOG DEVICES INC. TRANSCEIVER TOOLBOX SUPPORT PACKAGE
% Analog Devices Inc. Transceiver Toolbox Support Package for Analog 
% Devices transceivers enable the user in designing and prototyping 
% practical wireless systems. Using MATLAB system objects provided with 
% this support package, you can use ADI transceiver products to either 
% capture streaming RF data and apply signal processing algorithms in 
% MATLAB or utilize the provided HDL infrastructre to develop targetable 
% designs that process RF data on the fly, thereby facilitating 
% the design, development and testing of modem designs under real-world 
% conditions.
